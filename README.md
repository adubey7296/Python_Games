## Simple Games Using Python:

### 1.Rock paper scissor game :
In this game, user gets the first chance to pick the option among Rock, paper and scissor. After that computer select from remaining two choices(randomly), then winner is decided as per the rules.

#### Winning Rules as follows :
* Rock vs paper-> paper wins
* Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins
*  Paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.

### 2.Guessing Game One :
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

### 3.Guessing Game Two : 
In a previous exercise, we’ve written a program that “knows” a number and asks a user to guess it.

* This time, we’re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
